# Tips for using AI responsibly

These simple tips can help your students successfully use Copilot and other generative AI tools. Consider creating a school usage policy or classroom agreement like one found in the AI Classroom toolkit to establish rules for safe and responsible use.

- AI as a copilot: Think of generative AI tools as your helpful assistants. They follow your commands and perform tasks well, but it's up to you to use them wisely and responsibly.
- AI is not perfect: While AI tools can do a lot of things well, these tools can make mistakes because they are trained to always provide an answer. This makes it important to stay alert.
- Always fact-check: Make fact-checking a habit. Do not blindly trust AI-generated information—always verify it with trusted sources to be sure.
- Beware of bias: Generative AI models can sometimes show bias in their responses. Always ensure you review the outputs with a critical eye and be proactive by adjusting the prompts as necessary.
- Always cite your sources: Ensure that you give credit where it is due by always citing work that has been completed with the support of generative AI.
- Protect your information: Don't share private information with untrusted websites or apps and read privacy policies to understand how your data is used. Don't forget you can use AI tools to summarize complex documents, but always remember to fact-check and verify!
- Mind your wellbeing: Communicating with an AI tool that can appear to converse naturally with you can be very tricky. Establish healthy boundaries with technology by limiting screen time and spending time with the important people in your life.

# California State University, San Marcos

University leaders use Dynamics 365 and the power of AI to establish a personalized connection with every student.

As a university with many first-generation students, California State University, San Marcos (CSUSM) wanted to increase graduation rates and empower social mobility for its diverse population. To do this, they knew they had to find a way to connect with each student, personalize their college experience, and meet their individual needs.

CSUSM used Dynamics 365 Customer Insights "journeys" to tailor the faculty's communications for each student—both digitally and in person—while responding to students' unique interactions and preferences. Dynamics also transformed the school's systems, which were fragmented and siloed, and consolidated their data. University leaders used AI-powered insights to individualize communications and points of interest for every student, resulting in greater attendance and engagement at school-sponsored events and support that continued beyond graduation.

- How do your current needs align to the driving forces behind CSUSM's story? Is this implementation model a good fit?
- What are the advantages of seeking insights into your students' communication preferences?
- Would this model effectively streamline your current data management systems?

"Universities can be complicated for any student, but it can be especially challenging for first-generation students. It's important to know where each of our students are in their lifecycle journeys. To do that, we needed AI technologies that are flexible and can grow with the university."
